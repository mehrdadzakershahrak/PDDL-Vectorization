# PDDL-Vectorization

A project to vectorize PDDL textual descriptions using an encoder-decoder architecture.

## Modules:

1. **Encoder-Decoder Architecture**: Vectorize PDDL descriptions and revert them back to human-readable format.
2. **Vector Space Representation**: Represent planning problems in a vector space for structured exploration.
3. **Plan Generation and Search**: Navigate between state vectors and decode actions for plan generation.
4. **Evaluation and Optimization**: Refine vector representations and improve plan quality.
